You will learn here how to run the code snippets depending on your operating system.

The following steps will allow you to run the code snippets within a few minutes under Windows with WAMP server.

The 2 first steps describe how to install a PHP server (namely Wampserver). Skip them if you already have your own PHP server running.
• Download and install WampServer at http://www.wampserver.com/en. Just leave the default parameters when installing.
• Check that PHP server runs well by starting Wamp: Start -> All Programs -> WampServer -> Start WampServer, wait a few seconds et type in your favorite internet browser the URL "http://localhost".

You should get a page that displays information about PHP. From now, your PHP server is properly installed!

Once Wamp is installed, you can see its icon in the tray. When clicking on the icon, you'll get the menu.

The following steps explain how to run your first code snippets.

• Activate the following extensions through your php.ini file (the one of the PHP folder if running CLI or the one of the Apache folder if running the server):
  + curl
  + open ssl
  + soap
• Restart your webserver if you've modified your php.ini
• Unzip the archive you've downloaded in the folder C:\wamp\www\mytest. The folder C:\Wamp\www\mytest should contain folders, among other COMMON, M2M and sample
• Edit the ini file m2m.ini stored in the M2M folder to input your own connection settings (credentials, URL, proxy, ...)
• You are now ready to run one of the PHP file in sample folder! First check that WampServer does run. 
• On the http://localhost webpage, you can see a section "Vos Projets" or "Your Projects". Below, you'll find the project called "mytest". Click on that link.
• Click now on sample.
• Choose one of the snippets to run!

Note: you can also run the sample in CLI mode: <php.exe> <one_sample.php>

You'll find hereafter some commands to install PHP under Unix. These commands were run under Ubuntu and Debian. You may need to modify them for your environment.

• sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc mysql-server php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql phpmyadmin
• sudo apt-get install php5-cli (if you wish / need to use PHP through commandline)
• sudo apt-get install php5-curl (you will need this option to call the APIs)
• sudo apt-get install php5-soap (you will need this option to call the APIs)
• Install also open ssl 

Edit apache2.conf file: Alias /sdk/ "/project/php/" <Directory "/project/php/">Order allow,deny Allow from all </Directory>.

Then, you are ready to run the SDK. Since you're under Unix, mind the upper- and lowercase!

• Unzip the archive you've downloaded in the folder mytest. The folder mytest should contain several folders, among other COMMON, M2M and sample
• Edit the ini file m2m.ini stored in the M2M folder to input your own connection settings (credentials, URL, proxy, ...).
• You are now ready to run one of the PHP file in sample folder!
• Go to the http://localhost:port/.../sample to run the snippets!

Note: you can also run the sample in CLI mode: <php> <one_sample.php>
